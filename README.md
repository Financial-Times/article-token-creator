## Article Token Creator

This is an NPM module which exposes a single function which is used for creating FT gift token cookies. This function does not create the cookie, it instead returns a Cookie string.

## Development

This requires Node.JS to be installed on your system alongside NPM.
Check-out the repository and run `npm install` in the directory. If that has worked you should now be able to run `npm test`, which should return all tests as passing. You are now ready to develop.
